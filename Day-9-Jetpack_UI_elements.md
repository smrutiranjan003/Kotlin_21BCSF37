## Nesting of Layouts

Nesting layouts refer to organizing UI elements within a hierarchical structure. This approach allows for better organization and management of UI components in an app. In Material Design, layouts are often nested to create more complex and responsive user interfaces.

## Material Design

Material Design is a design language developed by Google that emphasizes a clean and intuitive user interface. It focuses on realistic lighting, motion, and interactions to create a cohesive user experience across different platforms and devices.

## Material Theme

Material Theme is a set of design guidelines and components that define the visual style of an app. It includes color schemes, typography, and other design elements to ensure consistency and coherence in the app's appearance.

## Scaffold

Scaffold in Jetpack Compose provides a powerful and flexible foundation for building app screens with a modern, declarative approach using Kotlin. It adheres to Material Design principles and offers seamless integration with other Jetpack libraries like Navigation. Scaffold includes commonly used UI elements such as app bars (top bars), bottom navigation bars, and floating action buttons, serving as the foundation for building app screens quickly and efficiently.

## Top Bar

Also known as an app bar, the top bar is a UI element typically located at the top of the screen. It often contains the app's title, navigation icons, and other actions relevant to the current screen.

## Bottom Bar

A bottom navigation bar is a UI element placed at the bottom of the screen, usually used for navigating between different sections or views within the app.

## Floating Action Button (FAB)

FAB is a circular button that floats above the content and serves as a primary action in an app. It is often used for adding new content, initiating a new task, or triggering the most common action within the app.

## Bottom Sheets/Bottom Card

Bottom sheets or bottom cards are UI components that slide up from the bottom of the screen to present additional content or options. They are often used for displaying supplementary information or actions without obstructing the main content.

## Switch

A switch is a UI element used for toggling between two states, typically representing an on/off or enabled/disabled state.

## Divider

A divider is a horizontal line used to visually separate content within a layout. It helps to improve readability and organization of the UI elements.

## Progress Indicators

Progress indicators are visual elements used to convey the status of an ongoing operation or task. They come in various forms such as circular spinners, progress bars, or linear indicators.

## Slider

A slider is a UI control that allows users to select a value from a range by dragging a thumb along a track. It is commonly used for adjusting settings like volume or brightness.

## Card

A card is a container used to present content in a structured and visually appealing way. It typically contains related information such as text, images, or actions.

## Chip

A chip is a compact UI element used to represent a piece of information, attribute, or action. It is often used for displaying tags, labels, or filters in a visually distinct manner.

## Assist Chip

Assist chips are a variation of chips that provide contextual suggestions or actions based on user input. They can dynamically change based on the user's interactions or preferences.

## Checkbox

A checkbox is a UI element used to allow users to select or deselect an option. It is commonly used in forms or settings to enable users to make multiple selections.

## Badges

Badges are visual indicators used to display supplementary information such as notification counts, status updates, or contextual cues. They are often displayed as small icons or text labels overlaid on top of other UI elements.
